This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the Chaotic Slime Mould Optimization Algorithm (CSMA) for optimal load-shedding in distribution systems. The repository includes code for the IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CSMA algorithm in handling load-shedding scenarios.

The repository includes the following code:

**islandA_33bus_csma.m**: MATLAB script implementing the CSMO algorithm for the IEEE 33-bus system. This script is used for simulating islanding scenarios and optimizing load-shedding within the network.
  
**csma_69bus.m**: MATLAB script implementing the CSMO algorithm for the IEEE 69-bus system. This script focuses on optimizing load-shedding to maintain stability and efficiency in larger distribution networks.

**Load Flow Functions**: All necessary load flow calculation functions are included in the repository, enabling the simulation of various scenarios within the distribution systems.
